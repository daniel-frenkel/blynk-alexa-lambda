Arduino, Alexa, and Lambda code for activating an LED via Alexa. 

Use this code along with the tutorial located on https://morningrod.com/blogs/news/build-a-native-blynk-and-alexa-skill

Included in this repo is code for your arduino project that turns an LED light on and off using Blynk. It also includes code for a lambda function that hits the blynk HTTP "api" ... and the code for an Alexa skill that will hit the lambda function to interact with the Blynk "api".
